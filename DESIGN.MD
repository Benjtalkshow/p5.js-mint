I created a custom flow for the mint SVG as NFT action.

Step 1:
click on the MINT AS NFT button which opens up the NFT SECTION MODAL

step 2:
fill out the details of the nft to be minted such as the name of the NFT and a little description.

The NFT url would be automatically generated from the name and added into the form as a hidden value.

step 3:
click on next which opens up the artist section.

step 4:

Fill out the Artist section like the name and artist bio. the artist's profile url can be auto generated given their name or retrieved from their login details and added as a hidden input value to be sent to the smart contract.

step 5:
click on mint NFT to confirm mint and inittaiate the smart contract to mint the svg as nft.

below is the link to a sample design flow for this action.
