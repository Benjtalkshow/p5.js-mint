I created a custom flow for the mint SVG as NFT action.

Step 1:
click on the MINT AS NFT button which opens up the NFT SERIES CREATION MODAL

step 2:
fill out the details of the nft to be minted such as the name of the series and a little description. Also fill out the name of the series and the description.

Then add the base url.

step 3:
click on next which opens up the mint NFT section.

step 4:

Fill out the details about the NFT such as the name, a litle description, choose the series the nft belongs to and do anything else required.

step 5:
click on mint NFT to confirm mint and inittaiate the smart contract to mint the svg as nft.

below is the link to a sample design flow for this action.

I suggest the artist metadata be managerd in the series struct as it would give away to add or find artists within a series.

PS: I'm not that much of a designer though but i did try..
